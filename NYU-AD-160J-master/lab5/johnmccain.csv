"6425923706","John McCain","Drum roll please... here are the top 10 examples of outlandish government spending from Tom Coburn's 2014 #Wastebook:

10. $10K National Endowment for the Arts grant to produce “Zombie in Love,” a musical about a teenage zombie “dying to find true love.""
9. $146M in tax-free subsidies - which would otherwise fund public infrastructure projects - to build lavish sports stadiums.
8. $171K to study what monkeys playing video games and gambling reveals about free will.
7. $331K to study how often spouses stab voodoo dolls when they are “hangry.”
6. $124.3M to contractor USIS that submited 665K fake security checks and gave Edward Snowden the all-clear.
5. $200K anti-terror grant to Ithaca, NY – named America’s “most secure” small town – to buy state-of-the-art SWAT equipment.
4. $856K for National Science Foundation (NSF) to teach three captive mountain lions how to use a treadmill.
3. $414K to build a free first-person shooter video game that the Intelligence Community fears could train terrorists.
2. $387K in National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding to give Swedish massages to rabbits.
1. $19M to put fed gov’t employees on paid “administrative leave” for disciplinary reasons - many for months or years at a time.

It was a staggering loss that still pains our state and nation today. The Yarnell tragedy is a grim reminder of the grave risks our firefighters take every day to protect our lives and property in Arizona and across the nation.

I hope all Americans will keep in their thoughts and prayers the Granite Mountain Hotshots and their families and loved ones who miss them so dearly. They are American heroes that Arizona can call her own, and their sacrifice will never be forgotten.","2014-06-30T22:32:23+0000","status",NA,"6425923706_10152572644988707",2571,625,233

"6425923706","John McCain","Top 10 examples of wasteful spending in the CR - the $1 trillion bill before Senate right now:

1. $65 million for Pacific salmon for states including Nevada. Flashback: Even the President agreed this deal is fishy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFcWz9eyovA 
2. Directs the Defense Department to overpay on contracts by 5% (totaling $15 million) to Native Hawaiian-owned contractors –  outrageous spending while we’re cutting vital defense programs. 
3. $154 million for military ‘alternative energy research,’ which last year paid $26/gallon for 450,000 gallons of alternative fuel. 
4. Adds $15 million to the civilian Air Patrol while we are cutting US Air Force pilots’ flight hours by 18%. 
5. $10 million for National Guard “STARBASE” and “Youth Challenge” programs while Air Force doesn’t fly & Navy doesn’t sail. 
6. Prohibits retirement of C-23 aircraft which the Army asked to retire and every US governor declined to accept when offered the aircraft for free. 
7. $120 million for infrastructure in Guam, which House and Senate Armed Services Committees specifically prohibited in the National Defense Authorization Bill. 
8. $14.7 million for USDA Watershed Rehab - which the Administration has recommended eliminating for years.
9. $993,000 in grants to dig private wells for private property owners. Digging a deeper hole for taxpayers! 
10. $10 million for USDA energy grants subsidizing electricity bills in Alaska and Hawaii.","2013-03-13T16:52:31+0000","status",NA,"6425923706_10151546188193707",781,571,425

#3 - $25 million to study the health benefits of peas, lentils and garbanzo beans. Pretty sure they’re healthy. 

#2 - $200 million for Market Access Program, duplicative program promoting corporate brands overseas. Example: Holding “liquor mixology demonstrations” in Russia.

#8 - $700 million for “Agriculture and Food Research Initiative,” funding grants for pine tree research in Florida and studying moth pheromones.
