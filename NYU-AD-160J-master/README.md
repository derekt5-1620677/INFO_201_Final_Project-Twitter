# Social Media and Political Participation #

This repository contains the recitation materials prepared by [Pablo Barber√°](http://www.pablobarbera.com) for the undergraduate course "Social Media and Political Participation" (NYU-AD 160J), taught by [Prof. Joshua Tucker](https://files.nyu.edu/jat7/public/index.html) in January 2014 and 2015 at New York University - Abu Dhabi.

There were a total of six different lab sessions. The first two recitations introduced students to statistical analysis using R. The third recitation focused on Twitter: what is it? what data is available through the API? how can we analyze it in R? The fourth session adopted a similar approach, but for Facebook. Session five covered more advanced examples of analyses of social media data, with the goal of providing students with an extensive set of tools to use in their final projects. The final recitation covered additional examples, but was mostly devoted to help students with their projects.
